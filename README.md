# Calculator Milestone 1

Setup phase before starting to build the project.

## Built With

- Npm
- Heroku
- React

## Live Preview

[Demo](https://fathomless-stream-35094.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started

**This is the setup phase.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

Computer running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux Ubuntu.

Internet browser: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, etc...

Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Optional (For deployment)

Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

## Setup

Download the code or copy the git repository to your computer.

To install dependencies you need to run the following command in your terminal.

```
  npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

This project is deployed to Heroku, but you can use Netlify or other platforms you like.

For Heroku deployment we you can enter each of the following commands.

```
    heroku create your-app-name --buildpack mars/create-react-app

    // you can remove 'your-app-name' if you don't know what name to put


    git push heroku master

    // if you are deploying the project from the master branch


    git push heroku your-branch:master

    // if you are deploying from a branch different from master


    heroku open
```

And there you go! You have your app deployed to Heroku.
